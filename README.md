This poster project was an assignment for a graduate-level data analysis course in Spring 2024. The data come from two publicly-accessible datasets from the government of Maryland. The research topic was to find out if there was a significant difference in renting between white and Hispanic communities. I used OLS regression and tests of statistical significance to conduct the analysis.
